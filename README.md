# Helm Charts

This is my personal collection of helm charts, some that I have being using in some of my projects and I am slowly making them public as soon as I see they are mature and/or useful enough.

# Github self hosted chart repository

Part of this repository is my personal helm chart repository, a simple Github page I have setup. On every release I will publish a new copy of my helm charts there, please check https://fbdo.github.io/charts.

if you want to use one of my charts, please add this repository to your list of repositories, using the helm command:

```bash
helm repo add fbdo-charts https://fbdo.github.io/charts
```
